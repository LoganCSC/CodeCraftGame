# Welcome! [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/cswinter/CodeCraftGame](https://badges.gitter.im/cswinter/CodeCraftGame.svg)](https://gitter.im/cswinter/CodeCraftGame?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

This is the official repository for the [CodeCraft Programming Game](http://www.codecraft.org).


# How to build

CodeCraft uses sbt.
Most build tasks are straightforward.
`sbt compile` compiles the root project, `sbt test` runs all the tests, `sbt publishLocal` publishes the project to your local ivy repository.
To start a predefined game, run `sbt 'project testai' run`.


# Repository structure

The project is split into several submodules, each of which resides in a separate folder:

Project        | Contents
-------------- | --------
`collisions`   | Simple grid based collision detection.
`core`         | Implementation of core game mechanics, AIs and public API.
`demos`        | Several small programs for testing and demonstration purposes.
`docs`         | Root page for autogenerated ScalaDocs.
`graphics`     | OpenGL based graphics engine, 2D primitives library and models for all game objects.
`physics`      | Collision detection and physics engine.
`scalajs-test` | Basic webpage that runs a game using the Scala.js version of CodeCraft.
`testai`       | Main method to run a predefined game.
`util`         | Various maths and utility functions.

Within most of the projects, there are three source directories (`js`, `jvm` and `shared`).
This is to allow for compilation to JavaScript using [Scala.js](http://www.scala-js.org/).
The bulk of the code is inside the `shared` directories, with only some platform specific code residing in `js` and `jvm`.


# IDE Setup

## IntelliJ 15

You need to have the Scala plugin installed.  
`File` → `New` → `Project from Existing Sources..` → select root directory → `Import project from external model` → `SBT` → `Next` → select whatever options you want → `Finish`

IntelliJ 14 should be similar.

## Eclipse
I don't use Eclipse, but presumably this is relatively straightforward as well.
If you figure it out, please make a pull request to update these instructions.
